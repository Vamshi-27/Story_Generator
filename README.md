# AI Story Generator

## Overview
The **AI Story Generator** is a deep learning-based project that generates creative stories based on writing prompts. This project leverages NLP techniques and deep learning models to generate coherent and engaging narratives.

## Features
- **Preprocessing:** Cleans and tokenizes input data from a dataset.
- **Training:** Uses a neural network model to learn from story prompts.
- **Generation:** Produces unique and engaging stories based on input prompts.
- **Evaluation:** Assesses the model's performance on test data.
- **Deployment:** Provides a simple web UI using Streamlit for easy interaction.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of writing prompts stored in `data/writing_prompts.csv`. This dataset consists of a collection of creative prompts that the model learns from to generate new stories. The preprocessing script cleans and tokenizes the text to prepare it for training. You can add more prompts to enhance the model's learning capabilities.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Vamshi-27/SIC_Project.git
   cd SIC_Project
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### 1. Preprocess Data
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset:
```sh
python src/preprocess.py
```
### 2. Train the Model
Train the model using the following command:
```sh
python src/train.py
```
### 3. Generate Stories
Generate a new story based on a writing prompt:
```sh
python src/generate.py --prompt "Once upon a time..."
```
### 4. Evaluate Model
Evaluate the trained model on test data:
```sh
python src/evaluate.py
```
### 5. Deploy with Streamlit
Run the Streamlit web app:
```sh
streamlit run deployment/app.py
```

## Dependencies
Ensure you have all required Python packages installed by referring to `requirements.txt`. The project mainly uses:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NLTK
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Streamlit

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with advanced NLP techniques.
- Introduce a feedback mechanism to refine generated stories.
- Deploy as a web application with user authentication.
- Explore integration with voice input for interactive storytelling.
